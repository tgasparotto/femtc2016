~ Abstract
One of the primary objectives of fire safety is to guarantee the
evacuation of all the occupants from a building safely. Although fire
safety rules and regulations exist, they remain insufficient to guarantee
the safety of all building occupants and do not prevent the dramatic
events to be repeated. Especially in healthcare facilities, e.g.
hospitals, care homes, etc., the evacuation procedure is more complex
than in an ordinary building. This is due to multiple reasons such as the
large number of patients requiring assistance to evacuate or the time
required to prepare patients for assisted evacuation. Traditionally,
hospitals focused on horizontal evacuation. Patients should initially be
moved from areas of risk to safe areas. Furthermore, staff to occupant
ratio may be low, especially at night, limiting the ability to instigate
a rapid staff response and evacuation of occupants.

Considering the limited number of studies on assisted evacuations, this
work aims to provide a deeper insight on the modeling issues to simulate
such an event. Based upon a preliminary risk analysis using the Fire Risk
Assessment Method for Engineering (FRAME), the most critical floor will
be selected and modeled using Pathfinder, an agent based evacuation
model. Furthermore, the impact of different percentage of People with
Reduced Mobility will be investigated. Moreover, since the number of
staff may significantly vary in the same scenarios (e.g. during the
night), different ratios of staff to occupant's will be studied to show
the impact of this parameter on the evacuation process of patients.

# INTRODUCTION

Each year, in Belgium, fire kills and costs money. In fact, in 2013,
Belgian fire and rescue services attended over 22.733 fires including 236
in care homes and 79 in hospitals [@1]. These fires killed 51
people and injured over 1189 [@1]. In health care facilities,
patients may start fires, either accidentally or deliberately,
particularly by those who are elderly, have learning difficulties, or are
young people with disabilities. Those who suffer from mental illness may
be particularly prone to starting fires. In these particular buildings,
the occupants will be a mixture of patients, staff and visitors. Staff
can reasonably be expected to have an understanding of the layout of the
premises (or of the part in which they work), while visitors are unlikely
to have knowledge of alternative escape routes. Patients may have limited
knowledge, but will generally be guided or assisted to a place of safety
by staff or visitors. Further to this, health care facilities present a
set of challenges from the perspective of fire safety. This is due to
multiple reasons such as the large number of patients requiring
assistance to evacuate or the time required to prepare patients for
assisted evacuation. Furthermore, staff to occupant's ratio may be low,
especially at night, limiting the ability to instigate a rapid staff
response and evacuation of occupants.

How quickly people can evacuate will depend on their level of reliance on
staff and it will therefore be helpful to consider the various categories
of patient dependencies: **Independent** (ambulant), the mobility of
patients is not impaired in any way and they are able to physically leave
the premises without the assistance of staff or, if they experience some
mobility impairment, they are able to leave with minimal assistance from
another person; **Dependent** (non-ambulant), all patients except those
defined as independent or very high dependency. This category also
includes children and mental health patients regardless of their
independent mobility; **Very high dependency** (non-ambulant), those
patients whose clinical treatment and/or condition create a high
dependency on staff. This includes those in intensive care/intensive
therapy units and operating rooms and those where evacuation would prove
potentially life threatening. Patients being cared for in healthcare
premises will vary considerably in terms of mobility and levels of
awareness during a fire situation. There may be patients who exhibit
severe mobility restriction but will have a good awareness of the
situation, being able to co-operate with staff. Others may exhibit normal
mobility, but their level of awareness may be such that they present
unpredictable behaviour (including violent behaviour), which may impede
staff in an emergency.

Conducting real experiments in health care environments is prohibited
since such experiments will be really hazardous in presence of vulnerable
people. Another alternative consists on using simulation tools. In fact,
it is well known that evacuation models are powerful tools to study the
evacuation process in different scenarios and
applications [@2;@3;@4;@5;@6]. We can find several reviews [@2;@3] that
show the capabilities and limitations of these types of models. These
reviews show that, apart from their possibilities, it is difficult to
apply directly the current evacuation models to the scenarios that
involve assisted evacuations, due to the presence of vulnerable people
who cannot evacuate by themselves (healthcare facilities, kindergartens
and schools). However, few of them are able to simulate assisted
evacuations. For example, the EXITT [@7] model includes two types of
occupants, the able-bodied people and the people with reduced mobility
(PRM) in need of assistance to evacuate the building. Decision rules
apply only to the first type, and the latter type follows the decisions
and movements of their attendants. The BUMMPEE [@8] model can simulate the
evacuation of people with disabilities, and their interaction with the
built environment. However, it is not clear whether this model can
simulate assisted evacuations. The buildingEXODUS [@9] model includes a
theoretical model comprising algorithms derived to represent the use of
patient transportation devices during the evacuation process [@10]. In
addition, there are two models that specialise in the evacuation of
hospitals: The G-HES (Glasgow Hospital Evacuation Simulator) [@11] and the
Assisted Evacuation Simulation System [@12]. Both models have been
developed to consider assisted evacuations. However, they are not
publicly available [@13].

Another alternative is the use of other existing evacuation (or general)
models that are not explicitly designed to simulate assisted evacuations
but they can be flexible enough to archive this goal (e.g.
Pathfinder [@14], FDS+Evac [@15], STEPS [@16], etc.). In fact, some of them
allow the simulation of additional behaviours, such as travel itineraries
assigned to occupants, delays, etc. This could be used to simulate
prescript assisted evacuation procedures.

Only a limited number of studies have examined the assisted evacuations
using the general models. One of the studies to do so was completed by
Golmohammadi and Shimshak [@17] showed an analytical approximation to
analyse the horizontal and the vertical evacuation times, considering
three types of patients. This analytical model permits the user to
consider the number and the category of patients and the number of the
staff members and the availability of the elevators. Alonso [@18]
performed an interesting study using STEPS model. She simulated the
impact of staff to occupant's ratio on the relocation process of patients
on a sleeping room floor in a health care facility. She highlighted the
lack of empirical data and the limitations of using a general model for
this kind of scenarios, and suggested future development for addressing
the problem of simulating assisted evacuations. Ursetta et al. [@19]
simulated the evacuation process of an Italian hospital ward in case of
fire using Pathfinder.

Despite that the modeling of assisted evacuations is restricted, it is
commonly agreed that it is needed to differentiate between self-reliant
(ambulant) and incapacitated (non-ambulant) patients. Moreover, all the
incapacitated patients have a preparation time that may depend on the
type of their disability. For some patients, this preparation time will
include the processes to stabilise the patient's condition (e.g.
operating room), to disconnect the patients from equipment, to move a
patient from the bed to a transportation device (e.g. Evac+Chair,
stretcher, etc.), to just help them to get dressed or to gather their
belongings. Currently, there is a lack of data related to these
preparation times and transportation speeds. The values of these
parameters are limited. For example, Adams and Galea [@20] present an
experimental study to evaluate the performance of the movement devices
used to assist PRM in high-rise building evacuations. Based on this
experimental study, Hunt, Galea and Lawrence [@21] conducted a numerical
study to analyse the performance of trained hospital staff using movement
assist devices to evacuate PRM. Other studies [@22;@23] show some possible
ranges and values for preparation times considering different types of
patients for the sleeping areas.

The study undertaken here aimed (1) to simulate prescript assisted
evacuation using Pathfinder; (2) to evaluate the impact of different
percentages of people with reduced mobility on the evacuation process,
especially on the Required Safe Egress Time (RSET) – the time required by
the occupants to leave the floor and escape to a place of reasonable
safety; and, since the number of staff may significantly vary in the same
scenarios (e.g. during the night), to study the effect of staff to
patient's ratio on the evacuation process.

# METHODS

The methods employed in this study were a combination of risk assessment
and evacuation modeling techniques. The initial phase of the study was
therefore the use of the Fire Risk Assessment Method for Engineering [@25]
to identify the most critical floor. The layout of this floor is modeled
within Pathfinder using a third-party (PyroSim). And finally, a number of
patients with different individual characteristics were created and
distributed throughout the model.

When possible, the input of the evacuation model was calibrated using
experimental data rather than the default settings of the model. This had
the effect of making the evacuation scenarios as realistic as possible.

## FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT METHOD FOR ENGINEERING

The Fire Risk Assessment Method for Engineering developed by De
Smet [@25], is a comprehensive, transparent and practical calculation
method for fire risks in buildings. It is a tool to help a fire
protection engineer to define a sufficient and cost effective fire safety
concept for new or existing buildings. The FRAME method calculates the
fire risk in buildings for the property and the content, for the
occupants and for the activities in it. The method is not suitable for
open-air environment.

Apart from its use in airports [@26], industry [@27] and cultural
heritage buildings [@28;@29] this method has been employed mainly for
healthcare facilities [@30;@31].

## PATHFINDER

Pathfinder is an agent based egress and human movement simulator. It is
developed by Thunderhead Engineering. Its purpose is to provide an
analytical evacuation tool that could be coupled with an external fire
model such as FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator) [32] to form portion of
hazard analysis. The occupants are represented as circles moving in a
continuous space. It uses two different ways to model the evacuation
process (1) and agent-based model (steering) or (2) based on the method
of Mowrer ad Nelson (flow model) [33]. The model considers individual
profiles (walking speed and pre-movement times) implemented through
distribution laws.

# MODEL CASE STUDY

## FLOOR LAYOUT

The layout of the modeled floor is shown in Figure 1. As shown in this
Figure, this floor contains 42 rooms: 14 single rooms (from 13 to 26) and
28 double rooms (the others). This floor had three exits associated to
the emergency staircases, two nurses' stations and some technical rooms.
The lifts are not used during the evacuation process. The fire is
supposed located in room 13. Therefore, the East Exit is supposed
non-functional during the evacuation processes simulated.

## PROFILE OF THE OCCUPANTS

For the simulations, we considered two types of patients: ambulant patients and non-ambulant patients.

For ambulant patients, the movement and behaviour of each individual is described by several parameters such as the pre-evacuation time and the horizontal walking speed.

For non-ambulant patients, the movement and behaviour of each patient is described by several parameters such as the pre-movement time, which is divided into two components: the waiting time – the time undertaken by the member(s) of staff to reach the room of the patient – and the preparation time – the time undertaken by the member(s) of the staff to move the patient to a wheelchair or to another transportation device. Another parameter is the transportation walking speed – the walking speed of the member(s) of the staff while transporting the patient to another place of safety or while walking with the patients.

The values used for the simulations are shown in the Tables 1 and 2. The waiting times are dependent on the scenario simulated. So, they are not explicitly described here.

Table 1: pre-evacuation time [34, 35] and horizontal walking speed [36] for ambulant patients

|   | Mean |  | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-evacuation time (s) | 50.8 | - | 30 – 66 |
| Horizontal walking speed (m/s) | 1.00 | 0.42 | 0.10 – 1.77 |

Table 2: preparation time and transportation walking speed for non-ambulant patients

|   |   |   | Mean |  | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dependent patients [@10] | Evacuation Chair | Preparation time (s) | 32.7 | 5.3 | - |
| Transportation walking speed [m/s] | 1.46 | 0.09 | - |
| Carry chair | Preparation time '(s) | 41.5 | 7.9 | - |
| Transportation walking speed [m/s] | 1.50 | 0.10 | - |
| Stretcher | Preparation time '(s) | 77.7 | 19.2 | - |
| Transportation walking speed [m/s] | 1.04 | 0.09 | - |
| Rescue Sheet | Preparation time '(s) | 65.2 | 14.1 | - |
| Transportation walking speed [m/s] | 0.89 | 0.24 | - |
| Highly dependent patients [11] | Preparation time '(s) | - | - | 180 – 900 |
| Transportation walking speed [m/s] | 0.40 | 0.04 | - |

There is a lack of data regarding the number of attendants needed to evacuate non-ambulant patients. Table 3 shows some values found on the available literature for dependent patients. As it is shown in this table, the type of the transportation device used defines the number of required attendants to prepare the patient and to assist on the evacuation process. Comparing the different devices, we can conclude that evacuation chair and the rescue sheet require the minimum number of attendants (two).

For highly dependent patients, the number of attendants needed is unknown. Therefore, we suppose that two attendants are enough.

  1. **3.3.**** EVACUATION STRATEGY**

Traditionally, hospitals focused on horizontal evacuation [37]. Patients should initially be moved from areas of risk to areas where a &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; posture can be maintained; usually in separate smoke compartments. As long as it is safe to remain in the &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; position, it is the preferred choice to attempting vertical evacuation. Therefore, in this study, we are only considering horizontal evacuation.

1.
  1. **3.4.**** EVACUATION PROCEDURE**

In healthcare facilities, in case of fire, the objective of the staff is to evacuate as many patients as possible [10, 18]. So, in this study, people in immediate danger are evacuated first, followed by ambulant patients and then non-ambulant patients. For non-ambulant patients, those requiring some transport assistance are evacuated first (wheelchair, evacuation chair), followed by those requiring transport assistance (rescue sheet) and then patients who are being treated and/or would be difficult to evacuate (i.e. Operating Room, ICU, obese, dangerous).

Furthermore, we considered that attendants use the nearest exit and that only two exits were available.

1.
  1. **3.5.**** SCENARIOS MODELLED**

Typically, hospital rooms are single or double occupancy but for the hypothetical scenarios simulated, all the rooms are considered as single occupancy. Furthermore, the 42 rooms are considered as fully occupied (see Figure 2).

Scenario 1

All the patients are considered as ambulant. The other scenarios will be compared to this basis scenario.

Scenario 2

A mix of ambulant and non-ambulant patients was considered with different percentages of independent, dependent and highly dependent patients. We considered 6 attendants present to assist on the evacuation of non-ambulant patients. Therefore, three emergency groups were formed by two attendants for assisting each patient. The Table 4 shows the sub-scenarios simulated.


| Figure 2: Pathfinder geometry shown with sample occupancy |

Table 4: sub-scenarios simulated for scenario 2

| Sub-scenario | Number of independent patients | Number of dependent patients | Number of highly dependent patients |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1 | 28 | 14 | 0 |
| 2.2 | 28 | 7 | 7 |

Scenario 3

Like scenario 2, a mix of ambulant and non-ambulant patients is considered but here the percentage of the patients is constant (1/3 independent, 1/3 dependent and 1/3 highly dependent). In order to evaluate the effect of different staff to patient's ratios on the evacuation process, we considered different numbers of attendants (nurses): 4, 8 and 12. The Table 5 shows the emergency groups formed for the different sub-scenarios.

1. **4.**** RESULTS AN DISCUSSIONS**
  1. **4.1.**** FRAME METHOD RESULTS**

The Table 6 presents the results of the Fire Risk Assessment Method for Engineering performed on the G Bloc of the &quot;Clinique Sainte Elisabeth&quot;, located at Namur (Belgium). The calculation of the potential risk is carried on each floor of this building but only for the characteristic premises of the floor in question. The method gives the following results: the calculated risk for the property &amp; content (R), the calculated risk for the occupants (R1) and the calculated risk for the activities (R2). For a well-protected compartment, the three values shell be below one.

In general, the results of this analysis demonstrate that the building is well protected (R&lt;1) against fire excluding the technical premise of the 7

# th
 floor in which the potential risk for the occupants is greater than one. That conclusion is, in fact, expected since the recent conception of the G Bloc strictly follows the Belgian Prescriptive Codes (AR 6/11/1997).

For the upper floor, the risk for the occupants is important due to the presence of the machinery of the ventilation and heating. In addition, its height makes it difficult to access for firefighters. However, this floor is only accessible for the staff members who are trained to fight the fire.

| Figure 3: evacuation curve for scenario 1 (m is the mean evacuation curve, max is the maximum evacuation curve and min is the minimum evacuation curve) |

Scenario 2

A comparison between the mean evacuation curves of scenario 1 and scenario 2 is shown in Fig. 4. The results demonstrate that there is an increase in total evacuation time when assisted evacuation is performed involving dependent and highly-dependent patients. In fact, for sub-scenario 2.1, in presence of 6 attendants to assist on the evacuation of dependent patients, the evacuation of all the patients takes in average about 483 seconds. For sub-scenario 2.2, in presence of 6 attendants to assist on the evacuation of dependent and highly-dependent patients, the total evacuation takes in average about 2124 seconds.

Comparing the mean total evacuation times of scenarios 1 and 2, one can say that conducting an evacuation in presence of non-ambulant patients takes a higher time than a &quot;normal&quot; evacuation. This is due to the fact that the evacuation of dependent and highly-dependent patients is delayed due to the preparation times required and the waiting for someone (or some people) to assist them before starting to evacuate.

1. **5.**** CONCLUSION**

1. **6.**** FUTURE WORK**

This research highlighted a lack of data about preparation times, the number of attendants needed to assist the non-ambulant patients during the evacuation process and the walking speeds. Future data collection efforts are required to collect and analyze these variables.

Further to this, more research is required to evaluate the effect of stress and fatigue perceived by the attendants during the patient's collection.

In addition, future works could investigate the impact of training of the attendants on the evacuation time. Virtual Reality gaming could be used in the future to provide valuable insight into a real life simulation and highlight areas of risk.

Finally, future research could focus on the coupling of this analysis with the study of the possible effect of the fire itself. In fact, the fire has a direct effect on the evacuating population, e.g., the presence of the fire and smoke affects the people behaviour, and there would be the need to simulate this impact on the evacuation process.
